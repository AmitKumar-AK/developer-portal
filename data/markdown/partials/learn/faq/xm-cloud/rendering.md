**What rendering technology is supported using XM Cloud?**  
The focus for the initial release of XM Cloud will be on Next.js. Support for ASP.NET Core and additional JavaScript frameworks, like Nuxt, are under consideration for future XM Cloud releases.

**Can customers use the .NET Core rendering SDK as an alternative to Next.js for XM Cloud solutions?**  
The initial launch of XM Cloud will support Next.js only. Support for .NET Core is under consideration for a future XM Cloud release. XM Cloud is based on Experience Edge though so when it comes to content rendering, it is just a matter of using Experience Edge as your endpoint for the Layout Service.
