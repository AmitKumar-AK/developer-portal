**What about Google Lighthouse Scores integration with Salesforce? Integrations are very critical to winning with XP and XM and we've always had good answers for those?**  
If you license CDP then you could do a Salesforce integration or you could do a bespoke Salesforce integration. As for Lghthouse Scores, because XM Cloud publishes to Edge and then you're going to actually deploy to Vercel or a similar service, customers will get extremely good Lghthouse Scores because we're using static site generation.

In fact, this is one of the major benefits of going headless with XM Cloud. Performance is one of the key benefits.  If a customer implements their frontend using a modern frontend framework, JavaScript frameworks being some of the more popular technologies, then we really opened up the possibility for them to dramatically improve Lighthouse Scores because they'll be able to pre-compile/ pre-generate their web experience so that static experiences become static HTML and that static HTML can be hosted at Vercel. They can be hosted on a CDN vendor’s system. There's any number of ways in which the static HTML can be deployed at the edge for the fastest possible speeds.
