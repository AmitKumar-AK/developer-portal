**Does XM Cloud supports embedded personalization?**  
The embedded personalization capability comes with Pages and provides a fixed set of out-of-the-box capabilities around page-based personalization. Embedded personalization will not include API access. If a prospect is seeking full customizability or integration capabilities through the API, will need to purchase the Sitecore Personalize solution. 
Targeting experiences for all users to add personalization to page variations as you create them in Pages.  
Build each audience using a user-friendly interface to browse, select and combine out-of-the-box condition templates.Preview the content for each audience and view the logic applied in natural language.

**Is XM Cloud going to provide analytics?**  
Marketers want to be able to see analytics around their personalized content, which variants are being shown more than others or is there a difference in time on page for one variant compared to another?
So, XM Cloud provides analytics through Pages embedded personalization.

**When using the embedded personalization approach, does that mean there is no access to the Boxever SaaS interface at all for customers? Is the tenant provisioned, just not accessible?**  
For embedded personalization, it is bundled directly into XM Cloud and there is no direct access to the Personalize tenant (via app.boxever.com).  However, the tenant does exist behind the scenes, however you cannot access it as a user through a web interface directly.  All the configuration of personalization would be handled from within XM Cloud.  The embedded personalization functionality is quite limited, so there would be many cases to upsell to standalone products (Personalize, CDP).

**What is the difference between embedding personalization vs Sitecore Personalize?**  
We are including embedded personalization and analytics with XM Cloud.

Our approach is that we're going to give customers this core targeting experience functionality. This is the capability that is being included as part of embedded personalization. A customer can very easily target custom page variants per audience that they define.

Embedded personalization has a fixed set of conditions and you can put those conditions together and it's a closed set of conditions. However, if you want to expand them, you simply license Personalize and now you have the ability to create additional conditions. You can also utilize all of the other types of personalization that Personalize offers like flows and decision models and open entire box. XM Cloud offers a base level of personalization to allow customers to use some personalization and they can license Personalize if they need additional capabilities.

**When it comes to the implementation of CDP and Personalize, would customers also be able to do the segmentation and the analytics out of Pages or is this only for the page based personalization that comes with XM Cloud?**  
The embedded personalization functionality that will be bundled with XM Cloud is really meant to be a starting point for customers around personalizing experiences. The initial functionality will be focused solely upon personalizing pages.

There really is one principal capability within the embedded personalization service and that's the targeting experience. So that is basically the one capability that we're including within embedded personalization.  If customers are looking to have more control over segmentation rules for APIs or for direct ability to configure and tailor, they will want to purchase the full Sitecore Personalize solution.
