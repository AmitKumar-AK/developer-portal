**Is scaling done on demand by the customer or does this happen automatically?**  
Authoring environments will be scalable to customer needs. The Experience Edge delivery platform is scaled automatically.

**What will be the uptime availability?**  
The uptime availability will be 99.9% at a service-level agreement (SLA). XM Cloud also provides disaster recovery.

**Which data center regions will support XM Cloud?**  
Initially, Sitecore will support XM Cloud in the following regions:

- East US
- West US 2
- West EU
- Australia East
- Japan East

**How do we comply with the laws that some countries have regarding storing personal data outside of the country?**  
XM Cloud will be available in the five regions in which our other SaaS applications like content hub are available. If the customer has specific regional data privacy needs that aren't met by these five regions, then Managed Cloud is probably the option that we would pursue with them. If the Managed Cloud service can be delivered in their desired location.
