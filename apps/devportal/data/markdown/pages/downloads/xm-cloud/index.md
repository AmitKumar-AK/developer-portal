## XM to XMC Migration tool
This tool helps migrate content, media and user data from a source XM on-premises instance to an XM Cloud environment. The tool is middleware that simplifies entering and selecting data, and orchestrating the migration. Tool version 1 is based on underlying Sitecore CLI and Sitecore Content Serialization technologies, and supports XM on-premises releases 10.1 and later. 

*Note: this tool is not intended for migrating or converting site layouts/renderings.*

The tool is available in two variants: a graphical user interface and a command line interface.
