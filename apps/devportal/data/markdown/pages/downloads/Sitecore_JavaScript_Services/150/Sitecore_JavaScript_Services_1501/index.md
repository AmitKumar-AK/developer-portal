# Sitecore JavaScript Services 15.0.1

Sitecore JavaScript Services (JSS) is a complete SDK for JavaScript developers that enables you to build full-fledged solutions using Sitecore and modern JavaScript UI libraries and frameworks.

The following JSS products are fully supported:

-   [Server-side JSS components](/Downloads/Sitecore_JavaScript_Services) and
-   Versions of [Client-side JSS NPM packages](https://github.com/Sitecore/jss/tree/dev/packages) that were officially released on NPM starting from 11.0.0

Note that the Sitecore general [Scope of support](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/463549#ScopeOfSupport) applies to the JSS products as well.

The [JSS application samples](https://github.com/Sitecore/jss/tree/dev/samples) are supported in a limited manner. They were designed as examples of a JSS application, and not as ready-for-production code. Developers are expected to extend and customize those examples according to their requirements. Bug reports and feature requests for the samples can be submitted. Immediate fixes, Implementation assistance or advices for the Examples are not provided.

Note that there are community-based channels where the assistance with the JSS products can be obtained. Also pull requests and issues on GitHub can be submitted.
