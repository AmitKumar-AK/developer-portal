    **Consider Upgrading to EXM 3.4 today**  
• Sitecore no longer recommends deployment of Email Experience Manager (EXM) version 3.3 or any earlier versions of EXM in a production environment. With version 3.4, Sitecore has moved towards an architecture that separates major components such as message delivery, reporting, and suppression services into dedicated service tiers. These changes provide performance improvements to suppression list lookup and data reporting. Please consider upgrading to the latest version. Should your organization require the use of EXM 3.0-3.3 software, please connect with Sitecore at the earliest convenience by contacting your local Sitecore representative or the appropriate email address found here: **[http://www.sitecore.net/company/contact-us](http://www.sitecore.net/company/contact-us)**.  
  
**Dyn Deprecation**  
• After November 1, 2017, the Sitecore Email Delivery (Dyn) service will no longer be available (**[KB article](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/669456)**). For customers unable to migrate to Sitecore 8.2, you will be obliged to begin using a Custom SMTP (MTA) solution on your existing version. The use of Dyn to assist in the email delivery process is no longer a necessity in the use of EXM 3.4 and above.  
• Sitecore has developed a new **[Sitecore Email Cloud](https://doc.sitecore.net/email_experience_manager/configuring_the_delivery_process/message_transfer_agent/the_sitecore_email_cloud_compared_to_the_custom_smtp)** service, replacing the Email Delivery service. Customers will benefit from greater scalability, faster email delivery, global coverage and intensive email support. Should your organization require the use of EXM 3.0-3.3 software, please connect with Sitecore at the earliest convenience by contacting your local Sitecore representative or the appropriate email address found here: **[http://www.sitecore.net/company/contact-us](http://www.sitecore.net/company/contact-us)**.
