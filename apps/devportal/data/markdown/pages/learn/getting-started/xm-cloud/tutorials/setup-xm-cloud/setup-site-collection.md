## Setup a Site Collection and Site

Now, that the deployment is finished, you will create your first site in XM Cloud.

1. You can access XM Cloud via the XM Cloud Deploy app through the “Go to XM Cloud” button

   If you closed that screen already you can also access XM Cloud from the Sitecore Cloud Portal. Click the “Open app” button on the top right.

2. Under the Sites tab, click `Create site`.

3. In the **New site** step you will choose a site template. Choose `Basic Site`.

   You can choose to create an Empty Site, or a Basic Site that already has some content in it. When creating your own websites outside the scope of this tutorial or as a quick demo, we recommend using the Empty Site, as it requires less cleanup than the Basic Site template. However, for this tutorial, you will select to use the basic site.

4. Name the site `Company Dev`.

5. Select a pre-configured language, in this case, `English`.

  <Alert status="info">

   At this time, you can also select an existing Site identifier, or create a new one. This is required when connecting [CDP, the Customer Data Platform](https://developers.sitecore.com/customer-data-management/cdp) of Sitecore for embedded analytics and personalization. We will skip that step for now and start the creation process of the site.
   </Alert>

6. Click `Create site`, which will scaffold the website in the background. This will take a few minutes.

   Once your site is scaffolded in the background, you can access it using XM Cloud Pages and start editing the content.

7. Click on the website, which opens up a WYSIWIG editor where you can begin to edit the content, see components that you can use to edit the site, and switch between languages and your sites (top navigation bar).
