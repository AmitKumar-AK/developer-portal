## Overview

Components are the visual, re-usable building blocks to design pages in XM Cloud. You can think of creating a component like creating a ‘stamp’ that you can use throughout a webpage. In this tutorial, you will build the first component for your company’s project as referenced in the previous blogs, comparing the different ways that XM Cloud allows you to do so. We will use the XM Cloud component builder, exploring the no-code approach to building components.
